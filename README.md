# BiBc-DataVis

This repository contains a data visualisation plot, the R code used to generate the plot, and the dataset in question. 

The dataset details a long list of annotated genes, transcripts and proteins of the Drosophila Melanogaster genome.

The plot displays the amount of unique annotations for each of these categories.

An intersting observation we can make from this plot is that there are close to twice as much annotated transcripts as there are genes.
This would imply that it is very common for a single gene to produce two (or more) different transcripts.
Luckily this observation is in line with what we know about alternative splicing in eukaryotes.

Another point of interest is that there are less annotated proteins compared to transcripts.
This could imply that different transcripts can translate into the same protein, or that there are some transcripts that do not translate into a protein at all, and instead have an alternative or missing function.
